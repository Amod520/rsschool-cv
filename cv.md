3. I want to get to test myself in studying in a new industry for me. Until that day, only Pascal *(at school)* knew about programming.
I am working at a furniture factory as a process engineer, which I also unlearned on my own, by trial and error. Self-knowledge and self-improvement is the truth "knocked out" in my head, that I carry with me all my life.
4. **Skills in this industry are zero** :)
5. 
```c++
